# About Me

I'm Masashi, a 22-year-old freelance mobile engineer. I attended a high school for information technology and started my journey as an engineer after graduating from high school. Currently, my main focus is on Android app development using Kotlin. I have been involved in the development of my own app for a prominent convenience store chain, an official app for an apparel brand, and others. Most recently, I have been working on a new MaaS app.

Also, I've started developing personal applications using Flutter. I've also begun sharing insights and technical information through technology-oriented platforms. I commit at least 3 hours daily to coding. My passion lies in mobile app development, with a specific fondness for the Flutter.
