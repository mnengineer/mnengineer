# About Me

I'm Masashi, a 22-year-old freelance mobile engineer. I attended a high school for information technology and started my journey as an engineer after graduating from high school. Currently, my main focus is on Android app development using Kotlin. I'm in charge of adding functions and modifications to a major convenience store chain's own app, an apparel brand's official app, and most recently, developing a new Maas app.

Recently, I've started developing personal applications using Flutter. I've also begun sharing insights and technical information through technology-oriented platforms. I commit at least 3 hours daily to coding. My passion lies in mobile app development, with a specific fondness for the Flutter.
