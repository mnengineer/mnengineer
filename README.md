# About Me

I'm Masashi, a 22-year-old freelance mobile engineer. I attended a computer science-focused high school and embarked on my engineer journey post high school graduation. Currently, I'm predominantly engaged in Android app development using Kotlin and working as a developer on projects including major convenience store chain apps and the Maas application.

Lately, I've initiated the development of personal applications using Flutter, and I've also begun disseminating insights and technical information through technology-oriented platforms. I dedicate a minimum of 3 hours daily to coding endeavors. I'm profoundly intrigued by mobile app development, with a specific fondness for the Flutter.
